FAAST Tube System challenge (Makers Academy Week 1 Test)
=====

After working on [Boris bikes](https://github.com/MadameSardine/boris_bikes) we are now working on the FAAST system.

The FAAST system in a nutshell:
----------------

* There are a number of trains inside the system.
* Trains travel from station to station.
* Inside of a station, when the train stops, passengers alight and enter the carriages of the train.
* A Passenger touches in at the station and touches out at the destination station.
* Each coach of a train can hold up to 40 passengers.
* Each train is made of a number of coaches.

Bonus feature
-----
Charging system: passengers can only touch in a station and access the train if their account has more than 2 GBP.
